# Practical-Machine-Learning-Course-Project
Practical Machine Learning Project course in Coursera's Data Science specialization track


This repository contains the R code and the documentation of the final course project (in HTML).

The task was to create a machine learning model to predict the type of barbell lift based on data from several accelerometers.

The file Practical_Machine_Learning_Course_Project.rmd contains a description of the tasks and the machine-learning process using Random-Forests algorithm, together with the results.
